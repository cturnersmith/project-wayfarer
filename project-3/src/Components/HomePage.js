                <p><h3>SpotLight: Member Review</h3>Wayfarar is a great app when planning your Girls Trip. My friends and I found this app
                useful when traveling to San Francisco over the summer. We were able to look at reviews of the top 
                night attractions that catered to our group. Thanks Wayfarar!
